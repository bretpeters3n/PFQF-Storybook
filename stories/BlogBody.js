              <h2>Drones Enhance Bobwhite Quail Conservation Research</h2>

              <p class="byLine"><em>By Olivia Lappin</em></p>

              <p>
                With various uses such as herbicide application, assisting
                in deer recovery, mapping vegetation, and even detecting
                illegal poaching activities, the potential for utilizing
                drones in wildlife conservation appears limitless. Given
                the wide range of applications, there must be new and
                unique ways to incorporate drones into upland game
                research, right?
              </p>
              <p>
                During my master’s studies at Mississippi State University
                with Dr. Mark McConnell, I investigated bobwhite calling
                behavior and roost site selection. While working at
                Prairie Wildlife, I became all too familiar on how
                difficult it is to trap bobwhites, especially in low
                densities.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was hoping to trap bobwhites to radio collar and track
                them, but I was struggling to capture enough birds.
                Especially at sites with low bobwhite densities, trapping
                is challenging. After a few weeks, I contemplated shifting
                our research focus from bobwhites to cotton rats or
                mourning doves.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fortunately, we stumbled upon a research paper by Taylor
                Shirley and Adam Janke from Iowa State University. The
                paper explored the use of drones equipped with thermal
                cameras to locate and capture pheasants using nets. During
                the study, researchers managed to capture at least one
                pheasant on 10 out of 16 trap nights. On their best night,
                they captured four pheasants in under 30 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Given their success, I thought, why couldn’t we try this
                technique with bobwhites? After all, I needed all the help
                I could get to capture them!
              </p>
              <p>
                I gathered a team consisting of research technicians,
                enthusiastic volunteers, and a few PhD students and
                post-docs who held drone pilot licenses. Jared Elmore, a
                Research Assistant Professor at Clemson University and the
                Science Coordinator for the National Bobwhite & Grassland
                Initiative (NBGI), who was a postdoctoral research
                associate at Mississippi State University at the time,
                possessed exceptional drone skills and was eager to
                assist.

                With a few bobwhites already radio-collared, we could
                pinpoint the entire covey’s location. Once we had a rough
                idea of where the covey was, Elmore launched the drone. It
                didn’t take long before a thermal image revealed the
                distinctive ring-shaped covey structure!
              </p>
              <p>
                To our surprise, you could even see individual birds
                within the covey. Elmore maneuvered the drone overhead to
                help direct our capture team closer to the precise
                location of the covey. As we approached the covey, the
                capture team illuminated the area with spotlights when we
                were about 5 meters away. We then snuck in and tried to
                capture the covey using hand nets and a weighted cast net.
              </p>
              <p>
                We attempted this method on six additional attempts.
                Unfortunately, the results did not always meet our
                expectations, as we managed to catch birds only twice. We
                found that birds in shorter vegetation, like grazed cattle
                pastures, were easier to approach quietly, leading to a
                higher likelihood of capturing them. Conversely, we found
                it difficult to walk quietly toward coveys that roosted in
                native warm-season grass and forb fields where birds would
                flush before we were in capture distance. It highlights
                how crucial good cover is for protecting bobwhite from
                predators!

                Having successfully recorded thermal signatures of
                individual bobwhite during drone flights, we wondered if
                we could use similar methods to count individuals in
                coveys and uncover a new way to refine population
                estimates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many land managers, private organizations, as well as
                state and federal agencies strive to obtain accurate
                bobwhite population estimates. Yet, as is often the case
                with bobwhite-related matters, obtaining accurate
                population estimates can be challenging. For most land
                managers seeking to tally quail on their land, options
                include fall covey counts, breeding season whistle
                surveys, helicopter counts, or roadside surveys. However,
                these methods can require ample time, manpower, and
                financial resources.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through thermal imaging, we had some success, but would
                like to further develop the process in the future.
                Although there is still more to learn, and as technology
                advances, thermal drones could be a valuable tool for
                locating and refining population estimates for quail,
                pheasants, and other upland gamebirds. Additionally,
                thermal drone imagery could assist in capture of birds for
                research or help to obtain population estimates.
              </p>
              <p>
                While there are obstacles like needing specialized
                equipment, a licensed drone pilot, cold temperatures, low
                visual obstructions, and sufficient covey sizes to detect
                thermal signatures, drones show potential as a practical
                tool for researchers and land managers studying upland
                birds in grassland settings.
